## About
The objective of this  project is to build a simple game where the user has to guess a secret number that is chosen at random. Upon making a guess, the user will receive a hint indicating if their guess is too small or too large.

## Phase I : Too High? Too Low?
In this phase, the basic functionality of the game will be implemented. The user will be prompted to input their guess, and the program will provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.

## Phase II : Making it Random
To make the game more interesting, the secret number will be generated randomly within a specified range. This adds an element of unpredictability to the game, making it more challenging for the player.

## Phase III: Limiting the number of turns
In the final phase, the game will be enhanced by limiting the number of turns the player has to guess the correct number. This adds a sense of urgency and strategy to the game, as the player must make their guesses wisely within the given number of attempts.

## Usage
To play the game, simply run the JavaScript file containing the game code using Node.js. Follow the prompts to input your guesses and receive feedback from the program.
